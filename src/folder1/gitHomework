Steps:
      1.Create a local repository:
•	Create a new directory\project on your computer for this task.
•	Initialize a new Git repository in this directory
2. Create a file:
•	Inside the directory, create a new text file named hello.txt
•	Open the hello.txt file and write some text (e.g., "Hello, Git!").
3. Add and commit changes:
•	Add the hello.txt file to the staging area
•	Commit your changes to the repository with a meaningful commit.


4. Create repository in Github.
5. Add remote repository to your local project
6. Push your local commits to remote repository
7. Create a branch:
•	Create a new branch named feature
•	Switch to the feature branch
8. Make your changes on the branch:
•	Open the hello.txt file and add some additional text (e.g., "This is a feature branch.").
9. Add and commit changes on the branch:
•	Add the modified hello.txt file to the staging area
•	Commit your changes to the feature branch with a meaningful commit
10. Push the branch to remote repository
11.Create Pull Request on Github:
•	Visit the web interface of Github
•	Navigate to your repository.
•	Switch to the feature branch if not already selected.
•	Click on the "New pull request" button.
•	Select the base branch (e.g., master) and the feature branch.
•	Review the changes and provide a descriptive title and description for the pull request.
•	Click on the "Create pull request" button to initiate the pull request.
12. Review and Merge the Pull request:
•	Once the pull request is created, it will be reviewed by project collaborators.(on real projects)
•	If the changes are approved, merge the pull request into the main branch (master) using the merge button on the pull request page.
13. Check remote repository:
•	Visit the web interface of your Git hosting service and navigate to your repository to ensure that the changes, including the pull request and its changes, are reflected there.
14. Share the link of your Github project.
